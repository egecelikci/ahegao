> [**_Ahegao_**](https://egecelikci.github.io/ahegao) (アヘ顔) is a term in Japanese pornography for an exaggerated facial expression of characters during sex, typically with rolling or crossed eyes, protruding tongue, and reddened face. The style is often used in erotic manga and anime (_hentai_) and video games (_erogē_). A more realistic variant is known as **_ikigao_**.
